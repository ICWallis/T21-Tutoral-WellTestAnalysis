    "## 15. Feed zone interpretation in geothermal wells\n",
    "\n",
    "Geothermal wells typically have very long sections of perforated liner (often longer than 1km). This entire length is potentially open to fluid flow from (or into) the reservoir, though whether there is actually any flow at a particular depth during production (or injection) depends on whether there is permeability in the reservoir at that depth. In typical geothermal wells in NZ (and elsewhere) there are multiple distinct depths at which there is permeability - called \"permeable feed zones\", or just \"feed zones\". See Figure 4 of the introductory notebook for a schematic of a geothermal well showing feed zones. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is of interest to know the depths and relative sizes of the feed zones. This allows the geothermal reservoir engineer to correlate feed zones to geological formations to improve future well targeting, accurately model the well and its likely future performance, and maintain the well into the future (if targeted well stimulations are required), for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feed zones are interpreted from various data which can be collected from the surface via PTS (pressure-temperature-spinner) wireline tools. This typically includes: \n",
    "- Temperature profiles during injection, at different flow rates.\n",
    "- Spinner profiles during injection, used to calculate fluid velocity profiles for different flow rates.\n",
    "- Pressure and temperature profiles during progressive heat-up after injection stops. \n",
    "- Fracture datasets from borehole imaging (if available). \n",
    "\n",
    "Feed zones are initially interpreted from the data types above, which are captured during completion testing (injection) and heat-up. Later during output testing, PTS data are captured as the well is producing, and this data confirms which of the feed zones are active under those conditions. \n",
