# T21-Tutoral-WellTestAnalysis

Notebooks and sample data will be loaded here for geothermal well test analysis tutorial given during the Software Underground 2021 conference.

The tutorial livestream will be UTC Thursday 22 April 22:00. Content will be loaded here around 19/20 April. 

The tutorial will be livestream to youtube and available there for viewing later.

The tutorial will start with an introduction to geothermal wells and then cover the analysis methods for completion (injection) tests and well heating:
- Temperature log analysis
- Completion test spinner log analysis
- Injectivitly index determination

Production testing and pressure transient testing are not covered. 

Using python within the Jupyter Notebook environment offers us the opportunity to generate robust and repeatable well test analysis that can be easily audited, which is important given the high-value decisions based on the well test analysis.
We will demo how the Jupyter Notebook environment enables us to store the steps used to process and interpret data along with key metadata, which is difficult to do reliability in Excel. 

You should attend this tutorial if you are:
- Interested in geothermal wells and how they are characterised using injection testing and temperature logging
- a practicing geothermal reservoir engineer who are interested in using python for well test analysis

The Juypter Notebooks use methods used are an intermediate python level but, because all code is provided, a novice python user can follow along.
