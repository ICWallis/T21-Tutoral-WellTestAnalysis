# Transform 2021 Tutorial: Geothermal Well Test Analysis with Python

This tutorial was developed by Irene Wallis and Katie McLean, industry practitioners with extensive experience in geothermal well logging and testing. It will live-stream to YouTube during the SWUG Transform 2021 conference and will available through the SWUG YouTube channel for viewing later. Follow the link below for more information about the event and how to participate in the live session.

- Tutorial materials and setup instructions will be loaded here around 19/20 April
- The tutorial livestream will be UTC Thursday 22 April 22:00

**The tutorial will cover:** 
- General introduction to geothermal wells
- Overview of the completion test process 
- Introduction to temperature log analysis
- Injectivitly index determination (i.e., well capacity in t/hr.bar)
- Spinner data analysis (i.e., feedzone identification)

Production tests and pressure transient analysis are not covered. 

Python offers us the opportunity to generate robust and repeatable well test analysis that can be easily audited, which is important given the high-value decisions based on this kind of analysis.
We will demo how the Jupyter Notebook environment enables us to store the steps taken to process and interpret data along with key metadata, things that are difficult to do reliability in Excel.  

**You should attend this tutorial if you are:**
- Interested in geothermal wells and how they are characterised using injection testing and temperature logs
- A practising geothermal reservoir engineer who is interested in using python for well test analysis

The tutorial uses methods at an intermediate python level but, because all code is provided, a novice python user can follow along.
